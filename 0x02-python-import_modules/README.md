## Project Overview

The project focuses on Python programming, specifically on the concepts of importing functions from other files, creating modules, using command line arguments, and handling bytecode. The tasks cover a range of topics including basic imports, dynamic script creation, command line argument handling, module discovery, and advanced operations like bytecode analysis.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Import a simple function from a simple file
Write a program that imports a function from another file and prints the result of a simple addition.

### Task 1: My first toolbox!
Write a program that imports functions from a file and performs various mathematical operations using those functions.

### Task 2: How to make a script dynamic!
Write a program that prints the number and list of its arguments.

### Task 3: Infinite addition
Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments.

### Task 4: Who are you?
Write a program that prints names defined by a compiled module, filtering out names starting with '__'.

### Task 5: Everything can be imported
Write a program that imports a variable from another file and prints its value.

### Task 6: Build my own calculator! (Advanced)
Write a program that imports all functions from a file and handles basic operations based on command line arguments.

### Task 7: Easy print (Advanced)
Write a program that prints a specific string in the standard output in a maximum of 2 lines.

### Task 8: ByteCode -> Python #3 (Advanced)
Write a Python function that mimics the behavior of given Python bytecode.

### Task 9: Fast alphabet (Advanced)
Write a program that prints the alphabet in uppercase without using loops or conditional statements.

## Usage

Each task is provided with its own Python script. To run a specific task, use the following command:

```bash
./<script_name>.py
```
